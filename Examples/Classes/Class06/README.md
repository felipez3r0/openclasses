# Class 6

Putting it all together!

In this class we will cover several basic activities around writing HTML pages. The students need to build three different pages by following the instructions and linking these pages together using the `<a>` tag. 

## Workflow

> Page 1: HTML history (1 hour)

In the first page the students will explain how and when HTML was created, they should use images and all the tags they have learned up until now.

> Page 2: Photos (30 minutes)

The second page will present a list of photos chosen by the students, they need to find suitable CC photos on the web and then put them in their pages.

> Introduction to <a> (30 minutes)

Explain about the `<a>` tag and how the students can link files using this tag.

> Page 3: Hub (1 hour)

The final activity will be a gateway for accessing the previous two activities. In this page the students will build a list of links redirecting the users to ther previous activities. The other activities need a link to this page too.
