# Open Graduation Classes

OGC (Open Graduation Classes) is a method built to work with students, professors, and professionals to develop open graduation classes!

Using the OGC method universities can improve their classes, professors can share their content, students can participate in the classes building processes and professionals can suggest/improve classes to adapt to the actual needs of the market.

## The OGC method

We have a really basic and simple method to open our classes using the OGC method. Basically the idea behind this method is to provide a easy and collaborative way for students, professors, and professionals to contribute to classes content and format.

**How the method works?**

We have a folder for each class (in Brazil for example we use around 20 classes for one subject) with a base README informing about the number of classes, the estimate duration of each class and giving a summary about the content.

Inside each class we have the summary of that class, the basic workflow of it, and relevant links and activities for the students. We use a folder named Discoveries where students can share their work or their activities. This folder can keep a track of the work done by all the students over the different semesters.

In the [examples folder](https://github.com/felipez3r0/openclasses/tree/master/Examples) you can see a example of a subject and a class built using the guideline of OGC.
