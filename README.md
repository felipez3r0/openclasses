# Open Graduation Classes

OGC (Open Graduation Classes) are a method built to work with students, professors, and professionals to develop open graduation classes!

[ LOGO ]

So that universities can improve their classes, students can participate in the classes building processes and professionals can suggest/improve classes to adapt to the actual needs of the market.

## The OGC method

We have a really basic and simple method to open our classes using the OGC method. Basically the idea behind this method is to provide a easy and colaborative way for students, professors, and professionals to contribute to classes content and format.

**How the method works?**

We have a folder for each class (in Brazil for example we use around 20 classes for one subject) with a base README informing about the number of classes, the estimate duration of each class and giving a summary about the content.

Inside each class we have the summary of that class, the basic workflow of it, and relevant links and activities for the students. We use a folder named Discoveries where students can share their work or their activities, this folder can keep a track of the work done by all the students over the different semesters.

In the [examples folder](https://github.com/felipez3r0/openclasses/tree/master/Examples) you can see a example of a subject and a class built using the guideline of OGC.
